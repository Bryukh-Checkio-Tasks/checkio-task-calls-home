    Nicola thinks that Sophia calls to Home too much and this is too expensive.
    He took the billing for Sophia's calls for the last days and wants too calculate how much it's cost.
</p>

<div>
    The billing is represented as an array with information about calls.
    Help Nicola calculate the cost of Sophia calls.
    Each call is represented as a string with date, time and duration of the call in seconds in the follow format:<br>
    <pre class="format">
"YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss duration"
    </pre>
    The date and time in this information are the start of the call.

    Spacecommunication company has several rules to calculate the cost of calls:
    <ul>
        <li>
            First 100 (one hundred) minutes in one day are cost at 1 coin for a minute;
        </li>
        <li>
            After 100 minutes in one day, each minute is cost at 2 coins for a minute;
        </li>
        <li>
            All calls are rounded up to minutes. For example 59 sec &asymp; 1 min, 61 sec &asymp; 2 min;
        </li>
        <li>
            Calls counted to a day when they begun. For example if a call was started 2014-01-01 23:59:59, then it
            counted to 2014-01-01;
        </li>


    </ul>
</div>


<div>
    For example:
    <pre class="format">
2014-01-01 01:12:13 181
2014-01-02 20:11:10 600
2014-01-03 01:12:13 6009
2014-01-03 12:13:55 200
</pre>
    First day -- 181s&asymp;4m -- 4 coins;<br>
    Second day -- 600s=10m -- 10 coins;<br>
    Third day -- 6009s&asymp;101m + 200s&asymp;4m -- 100 + 5 * 2 = 110 coins;<br>
    Total -- 124 coins.

</div>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Information about calls as a tuple of strings.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The total cost as an integer.
</p>


<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
